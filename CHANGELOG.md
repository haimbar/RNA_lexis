## [0.0.2] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- **FASTA input:** when loading a `.fa` / `.fasta` file the header line (starting
  with `>`) is now used only to detect the format and extract the gene name; it is
  no longer included in `txt` or `txtb`.  Previously, alphabetic tokens from the
  header (e.g. `RC`, `PastedSequence`, `nt`) were prepended to the sequence,
  corrupting all downstream analysis.  The gene name extracted from the header is
  stored in the session dict under the key `gene_name`.  Multi-record FASTA files
  are handled correctly: all `>`-prefixed lines are stripped before the sequence
  records are concatenated.

## [0.0.1] - 2025-11-01

### Added

- Initial release.
